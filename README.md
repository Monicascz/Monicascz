### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a non-profit's external tracking tool. The nonprofit specializes in helping support individuals who are homeless or need extra support. The tracking tool includes adding new recipients, program types, service types, and is in progress of having custom metrics be built off of the collected data. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about UX/UI design and how a user interacts with a webpage. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project, always. I love collaborating and expanding my knowledge by trying new things and learning from the best. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my background and how I switched from working in a zoo setting to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email: monicascz92@gmail.com  
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact:  I am 100% Polish and am fluent in speaking Polish. I also really love turtles. Are those two things related? Definitely not, but if you meet me you, those two things will likely come up in conversation.
