<h1> Hello 👋👩‍💻 </h1>

<p>I'm Monica! I am a full stack web developer from San Diego, CA. 
  
  🔭 I’m currently working on a tool to help a nonprofit track the services they provide to support individuals who are homeless or need extra financial assistance. Check out the work in my pinned repositories. 
  
  🎓 My favorite thing about being a web developer is collaborating with others on challenging problems, sharing expertise with other teachnically minded creatives, and learning new skills constantly.
  
  🐘 Before being a web developer I worked in the nonprofit sector for over 6 years, most recently working for the San Diego Zoo. I would love to work on a project that involves animal conservation or supports non-profits to achieve their goals.
