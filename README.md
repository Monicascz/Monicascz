<h1> Hello 👋👩‍💻 </h1>

<p>I'm Monica! I am a Software Engineer from San Diego, CA. 
  
  🥗 I am currently working with Sweetgreen on a 3 month contract to build an internal scheduling tool using Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and React.js.
  
  🔭 My favorite project that I have worked on was a tool to help a nonprofit track the services they provide to support individuals who are homeless or need extra financial assistance. You can check out the progress of this tool on my pinned repositories.
  
  🎓 My favorite thing about being a software enginner is collaborating with others on challenging problems, sharing expertise with other teachnically minded creatives, and learning new skills constantly.
  
  🐘 Before being a web developer I worked in the nonprofit sector for over 6 years, most recently working for the San Diego Zoo. I would love to work on a project that involves animal conservation or supports non-profits to achieve their goals.
